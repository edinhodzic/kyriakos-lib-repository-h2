# About

Originally this was intended to be a H2 in memory implementation based on the [`kyriakos-lib-repository`](https://github.com/edinhodzic/kyriakos-lib-repository) abstraction library. It is however not a H2 implementation instead it is just an in memory map which serves as a repository. This library is intended to be used for prototyping, it is not production code.
